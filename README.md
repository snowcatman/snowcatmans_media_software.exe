As I am learning to code in python 3. For the last two months(Begining sept 2018). I am wondering if I can find someone to learn with. More over to collaborate with. I am using vscode at the moment.  I am  create simple software to organize media files. specifically to the Plex naming convention. I think I have chosen PyQT5 to create my GUI. As it is well documented and used in multiple operating systems(Windows, Linux, Mac, Android and etc.).  If interested please message me! I plan on keeping this software free and open sourced. With notes and all. Thank You. https://github.com/snowcatman/snowcatmans_media_software.exe
