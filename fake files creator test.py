# beginning of file
# My Beginning Notes:
# Because I am making this module(python script) portable, it should work in what ever directory its in at this time. 10/20/2018
# However, I am thinking of using this code in the future. So imagine if you will that I need to write the functions
# for other modules as well. So don't expect this to stay that way. thank you.
# I use plex server for my media. what I am doing is playing with file and folder names. but plex can
# not see the files if there under 300mb. I used robocopy to create these directories and files from my media
# collection. What I have are a bunch of zero(empty) files in there own directories now. Because I dont want
# to go throe the process again with robocopy(what seem to take overnight). I am using this opportunity to learn a
# little more python. I am also thinking this idea can be used in the future for (snwcatmans_media_software.exe).
# this module is called from windows 10 command prompt or console if you like. and i have python versions 2 and 3 installed
# python 3 is updated and other modules installed(such as: Kivy). At the moment i am using pycharm as my editor.
# Can you tell I am a total beginner.

# I guess I need to import other usfull tools from other modules? i still need to read up on modules.
