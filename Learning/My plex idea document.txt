Ok, keep coming back to github, as it has been very usefull. we have a main.py and a splashscreen.py so far. and what i want is an old school look i guess. where we have the splash screen come up and while that is happening you have the main program open up and loading just behind the splashscreen. as the splash screen is only ment to welcome the user and maybe show loading status and then fade away.
you will be left with the main program ready to go.

I am thinking becouse you can not open a secound window with kivy in its own proccess. that maybe a subprosses or in its own proccess that the splashscreen should open. so that is what i am studying now. how can we do that in python?

(update 11/13/2018)
needing to find out if there can be symbolic links on other operating system other than windows. like linux, etc.

(Update 11/12/2018): I have been thinking awhile now that I want to move onto the rest of this program.
In there of that, as I have been learning python code. I am making templates to use what I have learned.
right now I should have a working (snowcatman_media_software.py) Template, a (SplashScreen.py) template and a few other files in a (learn) folder of what I am learning.

I could use a partner right about now. someone that. that could share in there learning proccess and help me in the process to my goals.

(11/12/2018): Be low this line are old notes.
ok, I have been thinking. How am I goint to compair my files.
(update 11/7/2018): as i have played with the database idea. i have found that using the web site is much more fruitfull.
I need a database. That has the correct information on commercial movies. (for personal use)
So I will grab imdb.com database files to parse from. I will need to grab from other databases later.
I need as much info from my media files (for personal use) as I can get, and make a database from them.
(update 11/7/2018): I am thinking of creating a final in house what i have database or evan a what i grab gets to be 
added to the database, still in my thoughts.
I need to create a list comparison of all the information to comparing with.
Then I need to compair each database to make a match. 
As plex is able to use media center master information files and such. 
We need to duplicate how Media Center Master leaves files for plex to grab from. 
For example(.xml files, information inbedded in media files. etc.)
Once I have a match. Sence I use plex media server. I want to use the plex naming convention. For all media content.
Continue to orginise and filter. Write/Replace/Rename to files/folders, rinse and repeate.
Once this is done. Then download and populate each piece of media with it's the imdb.com(pictures:cover art, poster's, etc)
grab all information such as file size, quality of media, container information. 
to show uniformity
show end results
convert all media content to standerd file container and respective quality. 
clean all other information to mach and make uniform content control.

Finally, This is were I need help. I need to grab information that show's ownership. legitamization of content.
licences, recipts, anything that show's personal rights to the content.

Also. this is were the media companies can help. Making a persons media content ligit. Educate the individual's of the world on how they can go about there use and busness practices.

Finnally, open up to what happens to your media collection after you pass on. what rights do you have.

Make a chart or list's of media content rights and practices.

ok take what i got and orginiz it
grab aver file. DONE
list every tv show DONE
list every movie show. DONE

check for proper name year rating.
if missing any info leave alone DONE
if found info compair to current name 
comit to name change

take what i got and 
show missing files(make them zero files)

take zero files and replace them small video 
with comming soon files.

make shure comming soon files are in 
seperate folders from actual video media

be able to list comming soon files of 
missing actual videos vurses videos i do not have.
===============================================================
At the moment I want to write all the software in python.
I am thinking kivy will take care of the GUI.
Turning python software into an exicutible software for windows I think will be py2exe.exe(looking for advice for a better)
will be using ffmpeg.exe for media file conversions
needed free command line image converter
===============================================================
(update 11/7/2018): whats on my mind, so far i have been grabing and learning of the pieces of coding that i think will halp me get the job done. at the moment i am learning python with kivy. i have made a template for a gui that i think will be ecceptable. I guess for nistalga, i want a splash screen for this template. then thinking about my next small move.
