============================================================
Convert your ui file to a py file.
Open cmd.exe prompt and type a modified example of this next line.
python -m PyQt5.uic.pyuic -x [FILENAME].ui -o [FILENAME].py

Noting: That unless you made the changes in disigner that the layout 
is static. Meaning that if you resize your window, that the 
window contants do note resize with the window.
